# Employee_Data_Tracker

## The Spirit of the Project

Creating a user interface for non-developers is an invaluable task. The steps go getting a powerful and intuitive user interface start with the command line.

## Goal of the Project

This project uses Node.js, Inquirer and MySQL to build a command line application that allows a user to manage departments, roles, and employees.

## Project Requirements

- In starting the application from the command line, the following options are presented; <br> view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role

- Choosing to view all departments displays a formatted table showing department names and department ids

- Choosing to view all roles displays a formatted table showing the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role

- Choosing to view all employees displays a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to

- Choosing to add a department prompts the user to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database

- Choosing to add a role prompts the user to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database

- Choosing to add an employee prompts the user to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database

- Choosing to update an employee role prompts the user to select an employee to update their new role and this information is updated in the database
